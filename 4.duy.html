            <p><b><big>1 . What does it do?</big></b> <br><br>
              Cybersecurity is the defending’s process of many modern devices like computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. (Kaspersky, What is cyber security) <br>
              Cybersecurity is an important part of many fields of technology, from business to smart devices and computer, which can be divided into many different categories:
        “·         Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
        ·         Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data it’s designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.
        ·         Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.
        ·         Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
        ·         Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organisation responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organisation restores its services and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organisation falls back on while trying to operate without specific resources.
        ·         End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons are vital for the security of any organisation. ”

                  At the moment, there is some new technology to secure our privacy and information, such as Face ID and Touch ID from Apple and Iris Recognition from Samsung. Apple’s Touch ID is the first advance security technology that Apple ever created. The Touch ID sensor uses advanced capacitive touch to take a high-resolution image from small sections of your fingerprint, and from the subepidermal layers of your skin and then intelligently analyses this information with a remarkable degree of detail and precision (Apple, 2017). “It also maps out individual details in the ridges that are smaller than the human eye can see, and even inspects minor variations in ridge direction caused by pores and edge structures” ( Apple, 2017, Advanced technologies). To unlock Apple’s device using Touch ID, simply put the registered finger to the home button to unlock the device, but if you fail to unlock the phone Touch ID, you have to use passcode to unlock it. Face ID is Apple’s most advanced hardware and software that they ever created. Using TrueDepth camera, Apple’s devices recreate a depth map of the user’s face and captures an infrared image of your face by projecting over 30,000 invisible dots (Apple,2020). To unlock a device have Face ID, you just need to glance at it, if it didn’t recognise your face or need update your face data from significant change, it would require a password unlock and/or update it. Iris Recognition is the most advance technology that Samsung ever create. To identify you, the device scans your irises to take biometric information. “And because virtually no two irises are alike as well as being almost impossible to replicate, scanning your irises is a fool-proof method of mobile security” (Samsung, n.d, How does the iris scanner work on Galaxy S9, Galaxy S9+, and Galaxy Note9?).

                  <br>In the next three years, in my opinion, AI and Machine Learning will replace and make a huge improvement from our’s modern technique. Many organisations use a multi-layer security system. “This multi-layered security system usually starts with the best suitable firewall capable of controlling and filtering out the network traffic. After this layer, the second line of defence consists of antivirus (AV) software. These AV tools scan through the system to find and eliminate malicious codes and files” ( EC-council, nd, The role of AI in cybersecurity). In the near future, organisations will be able to monitor and response yo the security incidents by the build-in tools (EC-council, nd). The next-generation firewall will have a builtin machine learning to find network bracket and block it automatically if it might be a threat (EC-council, nd). It just not an algorithm; it can be analysed and identify the risks and stop it. In the future, the manual ordinary security task will be replaced by the AI and upgrade it into the automatical process. Some organisations use AI to strengthen their security such as Google use AI to block spams in Gmail and IBM’s Watson use AI to detect cyber threats and other cybersecurity solutions (EC-council, nd).

            <br><br> <b><big>2 . What is the likely impact?</big></b> <br><br>
            In the near future, AI and Machine Learning will be the game-changer for cybersecurity and many more aspects of it. As I said before, AI and Machine Learning will improve the efficiency of the security system and reduce cyber threats.<br>
            The potential of these developments will change the way of protecting passwords and authentication. “Let’s face reality, most of us are quite lazy with our passwords – often using the same one across multiple accounts, relying on the same password since ages, keeping account of them neatly as a draft message in our device, etc.” ( Remesh Ramachandran, How Artificial Intelligence Is Changing Cyber Security Landscape and Preventing Cyber Attacks, 2019). For example, in the beginning, I have mentioned some ways to protect our password, such as using our unique biometrical. But the attacker can easily bypass this function by using an image of you from Facebook or Instagram. But now the developer is using AI to improve the protocol of recognising to make it a more reliable system. Apple claims that by using AI software, there only one-in-a-million chance to bypass the device with another face (How Artificial Intelligence Is Changing Cyber Security Landscape and Preventing Cyber Attacks, 2019).

            According to Imperva.com, there are 20362 unique vulnerabilities in 2019, which increase slightly when compared to 2018. Because managing to check by human resources and current technique sound like impossible mission cause it takes time and no efficient. But with the help of AI, it will be much easier. Not like human, AI and Machine Learning will not wait to be the victim of the attacker. Instead, it is looking for the potential of vulnerability in the organisations and system by using many approaching ways like searching online for the prospective keyword on the dark web, famous hacker information and hacking patterns.     <br>

            <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/the-state-of-vulnerabilities-in-2019/#:~:text=Figure%201%20shows%20the%20number,compared%20to%202017%20(14%2C086)">https://www.imperva.com/blog/the-state-of-vulnerabilities-in-2019/#:~:text=Figure%201%20shows%20the%20number,compared%20to%202017%20(14%2C086)</a>.<br>
            The development of AI and Machine Learning will affect many people, from organisations, security methods and hackers. The one who will be benefiting from this technology improvement will be organisations and security methods cause it will be harder to bypass the system. But might be the attacker will use AI against its own the build-in defending system or create a new pattern to circumvent it.
            <br>The new technology definitely replaces some of the current job and some technology that we are using at the moment. Because it is faster and more accurate than human resources, maybe in the future, human resources will be reduced to invest more in AI and Machine Learning. It also replaces some of the technology we use to protect our computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks. Like I said in the beginning, with build-in monitor and using a complicated protocol, it will work more efficient, and the organisation will be able to observe what is happening now without waiting like the old techs. But the new technology will also create more job for programmer cause now they have to collaborate to create an IT and combine the Machine Learning with the firewall of many sophisticated devices.
            <br><br> <b><big>3 . How will this affect you?</big></b> <br><br>
            In my daily life, with the improvement of the new technology, I will be less worry about leaking my personal information. Because now the protection system is more complex and more difficult for the attacker to aim for many innocent like other users and me. Although AI and Machine Learning is changing the world slightly every day, my lifestyle will not change under the effect of it. If one day AI and Machine Learning are the most popular technology in the world in the future, it will open a new field for me to study cause it is a new field that needs to be discovered. Although AI and Machine Learning to change a lot for the cybersecurity industry and our lifestyle, I think it will make less change for my family and friends. For my parent, they don’t trust the technology and prefer to save it locally because it is more secure. And for my brother, doesn’t change cause he only needs the internet for social media and gaming, I guess it helps him protect his privacy and personal information. It would be helpful for my friend to secure their privacy and their future career when talking about cybersecurity.
