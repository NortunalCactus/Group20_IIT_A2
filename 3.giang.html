    <h2> ✓ Machine Learning</h2>
        <i><small>"Written by Nguyen Thi Quynh Giang"</small></i> <br><br>
        <p><b><big>1 . What does it do?</big></b><br><br>
              Machine Learning(ML) is a relatively new area in modern Computer Science, yet it has been having significant impact the progression of the field. In 1952, it was first proposed by Arthur Samuel under the form of Checker game which could learnt as it played.  Since that moment onwards, the theory has been utilized in many applications, as it opened a new way for people to optimize their program, as Arthur Samuel stated:” Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” <br>
              Reference : <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Ujm7v/what-is-machine-learning">https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Ujm7v/what-is-machine-learning</a>
              <br><br>The definition of Machine Learning is more thoroughly explained by Tom Mitchell in 1998 as:” A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measure by P, improves with experience E.”
            Currently, ML has been proven to be extremely applicable since Tech Giants like Google, Salesforce, Facebook, etc. are leveraging ML algorithms into their products. Particularly, some well-known usages of ML can be listed as: Manual Data Entry, Detecting Spam, Product Recommendation, Medical Diagnosis, Financial Analysis, Image Recognition, and the list goes on. The applications of ML are so widespread that people merge them into their daily life without being aware of them.
            <br>
            Let’s discuss a very typical example, most of us are vey familiar with Google and perhaps use its services for our demands/problems on daily basis. Back in 2010, Google declared that they were the first company to use ML into their technologies and services. For instance, its recommendation list after one types a word or a phrase, its Webs Rankings, and how it weeds out low-quality pages is fully or partly based on the Machine Learning algorithms. The technology for this recommendation system is known as RankBrain – a complicated Deep Neural Net Work that yields proper required results for users. Additionally, ML is also used in Google Translate to enhance the accuracy of the translation, its algorithms analyses thousands of millions of documentations that have already been translated from one language to another and figure out the most compatible pairs of words.
            <br>
            Another valuable application of ML is prediction of the stock market. There are many investment and trading firms developed their own or bought third – party algorithms to predict their businesses projection in the future. With the huge capacity of data analysis that Machine Learning offers, predicting the financial market is no where near impossible anymore. From the data from the past of a certain market/stock, ML algorithms can return the future trend , or it is also able to give markers for an event (plummets, peaks, etc.). Many people still doubt the reliability of those model but it is proving its position in the field day by day.
            <br>
        <b><big> <br><br> 2 . What is the likely impact?</big></b> <br><br>
        <p>With those being said, Machine Learning is obviously having such a great impact on the society, especially in dynamic cities and nations. Since various human activities are being automated by technology, Machine Learning can fully or partially take part in and even complement the automation processes. In a foreseeable future, Machine Learning is likely going to be a commonsense in many fields, in other words, we may not even be aware of how artificial it is. At the moment, in this pandemic period, Machine Learning is applied in many projects to generate data that predict the projection in the future; thereby, it would help to get the general vision and result in optimal measures. Additionally, there are many companies that provide scheduling service, which are highly on-demand currently since most of the workforce-related activities have been moved remote.
One of the highlights of Machine Learning transformation in the recent years is autonomous vehicles, and the brightest representative is Tesla. </p>

        <b><big>3 . How will this affect you?</big></b><br><br>
        <p>
          Unlike most people, I have not found any impacts of machine learning on my daily life for obvious reasons. To be more correct, I would say that it I got used to the changes that it has been offering, since the moment I got involved in Technology. That should be the case for other Tech people and professional as well. We’re exposed to new updates everyday and applied Machine Learning to make our work easier on daily basis. Therefore, Machine Learning is a commonsense among people with Tech enthusiasm.
        </p>
        <p>It is really satisfying looking at things being automated, and how data analysis is getting more and more approachable. By surveying some friends of mine who are working in other STEM fields, I got to know that they are fascinated by how efficiency is enhanced by Machine Learning. It reduced the workload for other people who are working in STEM by helping the handle an enormous amount of data and generate accurate result.</p>
        <p>
          To be honest, Machine Learning has a great future projection but it is not yet applicable for many parts of the society. People who are familiar with the traditional procedures usually find it not approachable to involve Machine Learning into their profession. For example, it has barely had any impact of the agriculture of Vietnam.
