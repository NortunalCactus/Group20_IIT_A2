    <h2> ✓ Machine Learning</h2>

        <p><b><big>1 . What does it do?</big></b><br><br>
              Machine Learning(ML) is a relatively new area in modern Computer Science, yet it has been having significant impact the progression of the field. In 1952, it was first proposed by Arthur Samuel under the form of Checker game which could learnt as it played.  Since that moment onwards, the theory has been utilized in many applications, as it opened a new way for people to optimize their program, as Arthur Samuel stated:” Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” <br>
              Reference : <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Ujm7v/what-is-machine-learning">https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Ujm7v/what-is-machine-learning</a>
              <br><br>The definition of Machine Learning is more thoroughly explained by Tom Mitchell in 1998 as:” A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measure by P, improves with experience E.”
            Currently, ML has been proven to be extremely applicable since Tech Giants like Google, Salesforce, Facebook, etc. are leveraging ML algorithms into their products. Particularly, some well-known usages of ML can be listed as: Manual Data Entry, Detecting Spam, Product Recommendation, Medical Diagnosis, Financial Analysis, Image Recognition, and the list goes on. The applications of ML are so widespread that people merge them into their daily life without being aware of them.
            <br>
            Let’s discuss a very typical example, most of us are vey familiar with Google and perhaps use its services for our demands/problems on daily basis. Back in 2010, Google declared that they were the first company to use ML into their technologies and services. For instance, its recommendation list after one types a word or a phrase, its Webs Rankings, and how it weeds out low-quality pages is fully or partly based on the Machine Learning algorithms. The technology for this recommendation system is known as RankBrain – a complicated Deep Neural Net Work that yields proper required results for users. Additionally, ML is also used in Google Translate to enhance the accuracy of the translation, its algorithms analyses thousands of millions of documentations that have already been translated from one language to another and figure out the most compatible pairs of words.
            <br>
            Another valuable application of ML is prediction of the stock market. There are many investment and trading firms developed their own or bought third – party algorithms to predict their businesses projection in the future. With the huge capacity of data analysis that Machine Learning offers, predicting the financial market is no where near impossible anymore. From the data from the past of a certain market/stock, ML algorithms can return the future trend , or it is also able to give markers for an event (plummets, peaks, etc.). Many people still doubt the reliability of those model but it is proving its position in the field day by day.
