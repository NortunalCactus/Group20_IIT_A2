        <br> <b>[ Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? ]</b>
        <br> <br>Previously, why I chose software developer is I didn’t recognize there are more sorts of developer related with IT field. However, by having referred Burning Glass data, I can acquire several information that varieties of developer area. So that I’ve changed my ideal job as Java developer. There are two specific reasons.
        <br>First of all, because Java developer deal with much specific area than software developer, it would have more job opportunities in the future when I would be supposed to be hired. For example, Java developer is ranked higher than software developer in Job Titles of Burning Glass data. It means Java developer is much necessary and high demand job in IT field. It doesn’t mean software developer is not so necessary job, I believe that the more my ideal job is required at company, the more I could take chance to be employed.
        <br>Next, since Java has high utilization and can be appliable in a number of operating system in a tale, I can develop various application and organize system and website. My final destination in my work is develop application. Also, I have a lot of interesting about creating website. For this reason, Java developer is attractive to me by its variety of develop.

                <br> <br>After looking at the Burning Glass data, I think I will keep my Idea job, to be a front-end developer. As I expected, both of my generic skills and my It skills meet my requirements. Creativity, time management and teamwork/collaboration are my most important skills set and they are in the top 13 of the given table. These mean I can easily find my perfect job based on my generic skills set. On the contrast, my IT-specific skill is listed at the bottom of the chart. It doesn’t mean that I can’t find a job for me, it just keeps on people because it is very hard to study and master it. But if I successfully find one, it will be a well-paid job.<br><br> <hr>

                        <br> <br>After having looked at Burning Glass data, the number doesn't match my expectations. However, I still looking forward to following my idea job since the idea that doing what you love makes work effortless even if it does not meet the needs in the jobs market. Moreover, even though the required skills listed explicitly, as security engineer, there are way more you can learn. For example, if someone's responsible for carrying out penetration testing on a server/ product, the most important thing is having an out-of-the-box mindset, technical skills are really minor and can be achieved quickly. Where and when to applied is the most essential factor for the whole process.<br><br> <hr>

                        <br> <b>[ Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? ]</b>
                        <br> <br>After looking at the Burning Glass data, I think I will keep my Idea job, to be a front-end developer. As I expected, both of my generic skills and my It skills meet my requirements. Creativity, time management and teamwork/collaboration are my most important skills set and they are in the top 13 of the given table. These mean I can easily find my perfect job based on my generic skills set. On the contrast, my IT-specific skill is listed at the bottom of the chart. It doesn’t mean that I can’t find a job for me, it just keeps on people because it is very hard to study and master it. But if I successfully find one, it will be a well-paid job.<br><br>

<b>Joo</b> : This is the first time to use GitHub. At the first time, it seemed to be hard to use and collaborate with teammates. However, the time goes to by, I realized that this site and program makes our work easier. To be specific, when I send files, I would use Facebook messenger or Email. However, the previous one is got file damaged, also Email is too complex to use. Meanwhile, GitHub allows us to upload ours as an original file without file damage. Also, after pushing our work, we can check the difference in change. To sum up, GitHub was so useful and efficient tool that helped our work nicely.
<br><br>
<b>Hieu</b> : Github is kind of a new program that a learned from this course. The first time I used this is horrible since I don't understand any functions and how it the works. However,  through many YouTube guide video I found that GitHub is very useful in group projects sine we can keep track of everything and preventing overlap. I used google back then for almost everything, but now I used Github instead.
<br><br>
<b>Giang</b> :
As a group leader, I have been using Github for both tracking my commits and monitoring other member's work as well. It is obviously a handy tool and straightforward if you know how to approach the right way.
<br>
Based on the data that Github provided on our repository, it does reflect the period of time we concentrated on the project. additionally, it also gives a vision on where we can improve -e.g arranging the work, rescheduling time range, managing deadlines, etc.
<br>
For bottom lines, Git and Github have provided us all the necessities that we may have not utilized optimally, but that will generates a motivation to understand more about the tool.
<br><br>
<b>Duy</b> : I heard about Github a long time ago but this is the first time I’m learning and working about it. When I first learned how to use it, it really hard because that based on the first version of coding so it is not user friendly. But as time goes by, now I can understand what does the command do and it much easier and save a lot of time for me to do and contribute my work to the project. I used to send files through Facebook Messenger or Email them about the changes I made. But now with Git and GitHub, I can do it by myself and notify the changes I have made by some simple command lines. Git and GitHub are very useful tool which helps me do my work and collaborate with my teammate easily.

    In the recent years, social media has been a game changer in the society, it obviously
    is going to have even more significant impacts on the future. According to
    <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/"><i>https://www.smartinsights.com/</a></i>,
    by the year of 2020, up to half of the population use some sort of social media and it is increasing exponentially.
    Based on that brief statistic, it is undeniable that social media is a necessity for many modern individuals.
    With that being said, our team had a discussion with each other and decided that our project idea would be a social
    media application, which provides service for a specific group of people. Particularly, our initial intention to target the population proportion who have coffee as a crucial part of their mornings (or even noon, afternoons, evenings). Or perhaps just as a hobby.
  </p>
    <p>
      Coffee production is a massive industry with a long history of approximately 500 years and it is still a
      fascinating product that people talk about all the time. Parallelly, the coffee industry not only plays a
      vital role in the food and beverage field, it does have such great impact on the modern service industry.
      It is estimated that Coffee is the second-most traded commodity globally- <i><a href="https://dealsonhealth.net/blog/coffee-statistics/">https://dealsonhealth.net/blog/coffee-statistics/</a></i> .
      Let alone in the US, around 64% of the adult population drinks coffee daily. There is even some joke that coffee is the most
      popular ‘drug’ in the world. With all the evidence above, it can be seen how many people love their coffee habit. Thus,
      there will be a potential that the demand of coffee lovers desiring to connect as a virtual community is potentially really high.
      As a result, our social media platform will have a share in the technology market it the idea is carried out and delivered properly.
    </p>
    In terms of the production operation, it will basically help gather people who love coffee and promote them to share their
    experience of with each other on the specific types of coffee. Additionally, there is a long list of functions that can be
    thought of, however, their general purposes will be around the need of sharing information among the community. More specifically,
    since there are countless types of coffee, and each type has plenty variations based on different places, culture, materials, etc.
    and that unique information can be spread into the community for giving other some detailed insights.  Our product will also strictly
    follow the characteristics of a good model of modern social media platforms, <u> namely</u> :
    <ol>
      <b><big><span style="background-color:#d6c8b0">　# Responsive　</big></b><br>: From 68% to 98% of users access various types of social networking sites through smartphones, so the responsive UI/UX means a lot.<br>
      <br><big><span style="background-color: #dec490"> <b>　# Decentralized　</b></big><br>: Ideally, you should create a social media website, which doesn't depend on the central infrastructure. The best option is a p2p model <br>
      <br><big><span style="background-color:#b08746"> <b>　# Protected　</b></big><br>: Also, your site must be secured from fake accounts and other similar unpleasant situations. So consider the protection factor: encryption/signature keys, blockchain data storage, etc. methods would come in handy.
      <br><br><big><span style="background-color:#b0956a"> <b>　# Non-anonymous　</b></big><br>: The very essence of these services implies no anonymity. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of social networks, it's necessary to achieve correspondence between the profile and the real person (using a phone number, a scan of documents, etc.).<br>

<h2><hr><span style="background-color:#ffffff">　Ⅶ.　Group Reflection & Feedback　<hr></h2><br>
    <br>
<br>
    <p><b><big>0</big>. Intro</b><br>
    <br>First of all, the group consists of four people from really unique backgrounds and cognitive capability. There are particularly two males and two females, one of the girls is not Vietnamese native. Looking at the group and the process as a whole, it was definitely fantastic working together. However, we faced some common obstacles that shared the same pattern with teamwork in university and any other industries. Every factor that is attributed to the outcome is worth analyzing and contemplating so that we can optimize the productivity in the upcoming co-operation on some other projects.
    <br> <br><br> <br><b><big>1</big>. The good</b><br>
    <br>
    In general, we have been collaborating with each other for roughly three weeks so far, and the outcome of the process is better than what we expected. Due to the diversity that we currently have, there are many out-of-the-box ideas given by each member, and thus some really interesting and enthusiastic conversations. Each member has their own authentic and unique idea that may have contributed to the big picture that we came up with. And because each team member has a different field that they are good at, we were able to compensate for each other's shortcomings. Also everyone has tried to make a conversation in English, even though our nationality and mother tongue are different, there have been nearly no problems in communicating.
    <br> <br><br> <br> <br><b><big>2</big>. The bad</b><br>
     <br>
     Since the baseline of the group is not totally a clear surface to start with, we did struggle a bit initially, in the sense of cultural and individual interest differences. Moreover, there are conflicts among the schedule of the group, one of the four is working as an intern so finding the availability for meetings was not as easy as it should have been. However, we found other means of communicating as alternatives. Thus the problem minimized itself. Additionally, the diversity can be considered a two-faced factor that not only has positive impacts but also a negative ones unfortunately. To be specific, there were some minor misunderstandings within the conversation because people are not completely comfortable with eliminating the mother tongues. Sometimes, we found ourselves being prone to delivering the information using our native languages, but that was absolutely neglectable due to the perfect English fluency of each member.
     <br> <br><br><br> <br><b><big>3</big>. The Fix</b><br>
    <br>By enhancing the current upsides, moderating the downsides, alongside neutralizing the differences, there was room for development among the team. Even though we could have done better in terms of finalizing the product, we have done the best at our most convenience. Lessons learned will be valuable for the future teamwork during the academic period, perhaps for the work in the industry as well.

          <b><i># Myself</i></b><br>
          I worked mainly in the CSS and HTML part. To talk about good things I did, I edited the details sensitively. However, compared with others, I suppose that I didn’t work hard and much like other members. And my shortcoming is I sometimes didn’t participate in face to face meetings. So next time, I should fix this habit to avoid giving an obstacle to other members.
          <hr><br><b><i># Giang</i></b><br>
          Above all,Giang conducted our group as a GOOD leader. So When our team had too many tasks or confronted complex situations, she helped us by providing several sites or her knowledge and made it simple. And since she is very professional with IT and creative and organized so that it made our project high-quality and variously. Also, whenever we needed to fix our work or faced problems, she conversed with teammates in a friendly attitude.
          <hr><br><b><i># Hiue</i></b><br>
          First of all, Hieu is a necessary teammate. Because after we separate our part, he  accomplished his own part without complaint. Moreover, he was cooperative and reactive to conversation . Also Hieu is analytical and subtle and has a diverse view. This personality is very significant to our group. He checked the fact that ours was plagiarised or not. Also, whenever we needed something new-creative ideas, he suggested his opinion positively.
          <hr><br><b><i># Duy</i></b><br>
          Overall, Duy can be explained as intelligent. He has various knowledge about IT, so whenever our teammates had some problem,he always suggested his opinion and solution. Moreover, he is very creative and sociable. This point made our team have a lot of conversation. Finally, Duy is very cooperative and reactive to our conversation, so that he made our group’s mood smooth and lively.

          <i><b># Myself </b></i><br>
          In my opinion, I find myself lacking in many ways. However, even though I do not contribute new ideas to the groups. I try hard to fulfill others areas, fixing small mistakes and bring out the flaws of the given topics.
          <hr><br><i><b># Joo</b></i><br>
          The first thing that needs to be said is Joo plays an indispensable role in our group projects. She and Giang take the most care of the design and coding part of the projects. Furthermore, she is capable of gaining new knowledge by herself and apply them to the tasks to make it plentiful and beautiful. To conclude, Joo is an enthusiastic and dependable person.
          <hr><br><i><b># Giang</b></i><br>
          From my perspective, Giang is a good leader who is passionate about the projects since all of us agree on her idea. She takes care of all the deadlines and notices with us whenever some part is not finished. In addition, she participant a lot on the website itself
          and create an alluring layout for the project that makes it easier for each teammate to put their information on which shows off her hard work.
          <hr><br><i><b># Duy</b></i><br>
          To begin with, Duy is an easy-going, confident, competitive, and patient person. Duy is an industrious person since he could listen to the interview and re-write it to a complete script, which was a massive part of the projects. Duy is really interested in develops himself and always reaches out to people for more information or something he could learn from it. Furthermore, I like Duy since we work well together.

          <b><big><span style="background-color: #edffe6">　Giang　</big></b><hr>
          <b><i># Myself </i></b><br>
          First and foremost, I'm really grateful that I had a chance to get to know other people in this group, everyone has their own unique characteristics but we all have the same enthusiasm for Technology. Admittedly, as a leader, I've not done at my best for the group since my time is occupied by some other things such as work. If there is one thing I could have done better, it should be eliminating the work-not-done. In other words, in the process of planning, I did let some unneccessary things hinder our efficiency, that will be different in the future.
          <hr><br><b><i># Joo</i></b><br>
          Overall, Joo is a productive person and a big contributor for the project. She always has innovative ideas in the sense of designing and making the interface more user-friendly. Moreover, she is completely capable of working independently, and constantly seeking new knowledge by herself. If she is labeled, it will be “the initiative”.Thus, apparently she is comfortable using supported tools and writing code for the assignment.
          <hr><br><b><i># Hieu</i></b><br>
          In general, Hieu is the spice of the team. He contributed to some essential parts of the project and is definitely irreplaceable. Though his nature is not necessarily energetic, he helped put the group pointing out details that we may have missed. Therefore, he eliminated many obstacles on the way for us. In many situations, however, he could have been more decisive and expressive.
          <hr><br><b><i># Duy</i></b><br>
          First, Duy always has intrinsic motivations that keep him up with the project progress, he can be valued as the most active person among all. Though, there are some shortcomings about him. Since his personality is more prone to extroversion, he sometimes exaggerates things that are resolvable.
        If there is something he can totally improve, that should be the ability of self-teaching, that is one of the essential skills for people whose jobs are tech-related.

          <hr><br><b><i># Joo</i></b><br>
          Joo is a passionate teammate that our team must have. She brings fresh new ideas to our team and always finishes her job on time. And she is capable of working individually and multi-tasking at the same time, which makes her a very valuable teammate. Her strength is about coding and css. But she needs to improve her communication skill because it is an essential skill in the future, especially IT jobs.
          <hr><br><b><i># Giang</i></b><br>
          As a leader, Giang fulfilled her responsibility. She always rushing other teammates to fulfill their duty with quality content.She also has the ability to lead other teammates through obstacles, and her well communicating helps us a lot about the assignment. Her strength is self-teaching and time-management, she might be the leader that I want to follow up to lead success. She is our key to success for our team.
          <hr><br><b><i># Hiue</i></b><br>
          Hieu is the guy who silently contributes to the project. Hieu brings us useful information about the project and useful tools that help us to do the coding. He also is a person who corrects others' teammates' errors and is always aiming for perfection in our project .But in my opinion, I think Hieu needs to improve his communication skill and contribute more positive ideas for the team.
