  <h2><b>Project: CoffeeDear</b></h2>
  <p>
    In the recent years, social media has been a game changer in the society, it obviously
    is going to have even more significant impacts on the future. According to
    https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/,
    by the year of 2020, up to half of the population use some sort of social media and it is increasing exponentially.
    Based on that brief statistic, it is undeniable that social media is a necessity for many modern individuals.
    With that being said, our team had a discussion with each other and decided that our project idea would be a social
    media application, which provides service for a specific group of people. Particularly, our initial intention to target the population proportion who have coffee as a crucial part of their mornings (or even noon, afternoons, evenings). Or perhaps just as a hobby.
  </p>
<p>
  Coffee production is a massive industry with a long history of approximately 500 years and it is still a
  fascinating product that people talk about all the time. Parallelly, the coffee industry not only plays a
  vital role in the food and beverage field, it does have such great impact on the modern service industry.
  It is estimated that Coffee is the second-most traded commodity globally- https://dealsonhealth.net/blog/coffee-statistics/.
  Let alone in the US, around 64% of the adult population drinks coffee daily. There is even some joke that coffee is the most
  popular ‘drug’ in the world. With all the evidence above, it can be seen how many people love their coffee habit. Thus,
  there will be a potential that the demand of coffee lovers desiring to connect as a virtual community is potentially really high.
  As a result, our social media platform will have a share in the technology market it the idea is carried out and delivered properly.
</p>
In terms of the production operation, it will basically help gather people who love coffee and promote them to share their
experience of with each other on the specific types of coffee. Additionally, there is a long list of functions that can be
thought of, however, their general purposes will be around the need of sharing information among the community. More specifically,
since there are countless types of coffee, and each type has plenty variations based on different places, culture, materials, etc.
and that unique information can be spread into the community for giving other some detailed insights.  Our product will also strictly
follow the characteristics of a good model of modern social media platforms, namely:
<ol>
  <li><b>Responsive.</b> From 68% to 98% of users access various types of social networking sites through smartphones, so the responsive UI/UX means a lot. </li>
  <li><b>Decentralized.</b>Ideally, you should create a social media website, which doesn't depend on the central infrastructure. The best option is a p2p model</li>
  <li><b>Non-anonymous.</b> The very essence of these services implies no anonymity. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of social networks, it's necessary to achieve correspondence between the profile and the real person (using a phone number, a scan of documents, etc.).</li>
  <li><b>Protected.</b> Also, your site must be secured from fake accounts and other similar unpleasant situations. So consider the protection factor: encryption/signature keys, blockchain data storage, etc. methods would come in handy.</li>
