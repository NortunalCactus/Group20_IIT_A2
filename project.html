<h2>✓ Raspberry Pis, Arduinos</h2><br>
  <p><b><big>1 . What does it do?</b></big> <br><br>

    Raspberry Pi and Arduino are kind of single board based computer and controller. The most benefit of those is that they are invented user friendly. First of all, those size are tiny compared with the past one so that it allows us that we can hold those in our daily lives. Furthermore, those are created as an open source so that every people can access to those and apply those to adaptable software and hardware, even create new invention by utilizing those. To explain specifically, Raspberry Pi is type of mini computer so that it could be connected with monitor, mouse and keyboard. Also, it works normally as formal huge and heavy existing computer. Next, Arduino is small single board controller that could be used for invention of environmental-interactive stuff, receiving input value from various switch or sensor in order to by sensing physical movement and controlling electronic devices.
    Then what can be done now? Since Raspberry Pi and Arduino is user-friendly and easy to apply those to a various technology, there are diverse products with Raspberry Pi and Arduino that could be used in daily life. Firstly, as I mentioned Raspberry Pi plays a role as mini computer when it connected with monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Moreover, it could be applied to making FM Radio Station. Putting some code for Radio signals and executing software on PC by using GQRX, it could be exploited as a formal radio. Also, Raspberry Pi could be used wireless print server when it uses Raspberry Pi3 and CUPS software for running the print server. What about Arduino? Arduino can sense physical movement and changes so that it has wide spectrum to become diverse applications, especially in agriculture field. Through connected sensor with Arduino, it could assume humidity, temperature in order to water the plant or monitor sensitive crop that is picky to grow.
    Furthermore, it has numerous potential abilities. I suppose if IT is popularized in the future, numerous people could build their own laptop by using Raspberry Pi. Like this, laptop is commonly and widely used on our daily basis. However, even though it’s considered as necessity, it is still quite expensive. Therefore, to solve this argument, Raspberry Pi would replace the expensive device by consisting small laptop. Moreover, Arduino could function of thermometer that comes in a set with a laptop in the form of a USB. For example, if a person who don’t afford to go to hospital due to distance from there, they could notice light symptom such as fever, purse by grabbing the Arduino thermometer or sticking it with skin. After checking their body heat, if the person agrees with sending the information of fever, purse for checking their health to pre-selected hospital, they could get their health state and also book to see a doctor by using Raspberry Pi small laptop.
    Then, what technological or other developments make this possible? Above all, to give a shape to my thoughts, small laptop demands speaker, Bluetooth keyboard, audio jack, battery, plastic box for holding, on/off switch button, LCD screen within 7 inches and Raspberry Pi. Also, USB type thermometer required temperature sensor, OLED display, battery and Arduino board. To come it in reality, firstly, it acquires to find several companies and plants where can make a mass production of thermometer components and also other components of small laptop at an affordable price. The reason we need to take companies and plants where can mass produce is every component should be low-priced for popularizing to everyone. Also, at the government level, they should install internet connection line all over the country for commercialization. After that, people should acquire how to assemble parts into a complete whole. If every requirement meets needs, the imagination would be come true.
    <br><br><br><br>

      <b><big>2 . What is the likely impact?</big></b> <br><br>
     <p>To illustrate the potential impact and change of this development, I suppose that installation of network for making those more popular would be likely to revive regional economy. Because in the process of internet server installation, there would be created a number of occupations. For example, nowadays, a lot of international companies are trying to develop less developed country by contributing money, install internet server, or providing educational support. In this process, it could offer various job opportunity such as tutor, manager and engineer. Also, I guess every component of device I thought up would be cheap in the future due to mass production. Basically, the more the plants produce part of device much, the much job opportunity get higher. For this reason, I think it’s potential to have a lot of job opportunity for underdeveloped countries’ people.
     Then, which people could be most affected? If every part of project is successfully fulfilled, as a first result, numerous people’s quality of lives would get higher than now, especially people who cannot access to internet server and who need basic healthcare service. For example, one person has a serious fever, people can check his body temperature and pulse by using USB type thermometer. Afterward, they can send the basic information and even book appointment to see a doctor. Also, they could conjecture what his disease by chatting with executive of hospital and searching much information on the internet. It not only doesn’t need to take too much time, but also easy to take much information from the internet. It would be great opportunity for people who have no chance but to stand their agony without information and interacting with professional health care provider.
     However, it is also discussed about its dilemma that this technology could be replaced or made redundant any current jobs or technologies. Personally, as I mentioned, this development would offer job opportunity for less developed country people. However, my idea is not so creative and future-oriented, there would not be various and so-new job. But one of the good things is installation of network and giving a educational job would not be replaced with machine. However, another one that is making component of electronic devices would be replaced quite easily. Also, about technology, it could be replaced with infrared temperature system that is take patient’s temperature without touching device on their skin. This is more sanitary, so it doesn’t make the risk of infection between patient’s disease or virus they had.
     <br><br><br><br></p>


    <b><big>3 . How will this affect you?</big></b><br><br>
      <p>First, in our daily life, how will this affect us? If it developed successfully, it would have a positive impact on my daily life. First, it could mean a lot. For example, by gathering every component (Of course, just in device level, not in screw, or install screen in device level) all by myself. It would give a feeling of achievement and satisfaction. Also, in the process of assembling, it could give a lot of knowledge about the function of components and device. Moreover, it is connected with my major, it would be very helpful. Also, as a frugal, it way cheaper than other laptop such as Apple’s and Samsung’s. So that it’s more economical.
      Moreover, it seems to be really different for me. First of all, in every level of assembling, I don’t have to be given a hand from mechanic. It makes me much clever and prevents from waste of money to call mechanic with lots of price and from waste of time to wait for finish of gathering all of complex components from center. Also, it could be customized as different and creative design. I really enjoy decorating mine with sticker and picture. The outside case would be plastic one, it’s simple to decorate with sticker, photo and others. Also, we can change the case by purchasing other color case at cheap price.
      Lastly, how might this affect our family or friends? To illustrate the impact on my family, it would be affordable to use in daily life. Because my parents always speak candidly of their difficulty that their briefcase for work is too heavy to hold when they are in long rush hours. So, the main reason of problem is heavy weight laptop, tiny self-assembling laptop would be helpful. Also, my friends always desperate to find several unique stuffs, this device would attract them by its characteristic that is self-assembled, easy to customize. And it is potential to add more function by people who is proficient at engineering, my friends would be likely to add more function by studying and getting much information from internet and related books.

<h2> ✓ Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h2><br>
    <p><b><big>1 . What does it do?</b></big> <br><br>
      Blockchain's Practical Application <br>
      Blocks on the blockchain store data about monetary transactions—we’ve got that out of the way. But it turns out that blockchain is actually a pretty reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions, as well. In fact, blockchain technology can be used to store data about property exchanges, stops in a supply chain, and even votes for a candidate.
      Deloitte recently surveyed more than 1,400 companies across 14 regions about integrating blockchain into their operations. The survey found that 82% of respondents planned to hire staff with blockchain expertise in the next 12 months, and 39% already had a blockchain system in production today. In addition, 36% of companies said they would invest $5 million or more in blockchain in the coming year.6 Here are some of the most popular applications of blockchain being explored today.

      cryptocurrencies<br>
      A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled.

<h2> ✓ Machine Learning</h2><br>
    <p><b><big>1 . What does it do?</b></big> <br><br>
          Machine Learning(ML) is a relatively new area in modern Computer Science, yet it has been having significant impact the progression of the field. In 1952, it was first proposed by Arthur Samuel under the form of Checker game which could learnt as it played.  Since that moment onwards, the theory has been utilized in many applications, as it opened a new way for people to optimize their program, as Arthur Samuel stated:” Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” <br>
          Reference : <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Ujm7v/what-is-machine-learning">https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Ujm7v/what-is-machine-learning</a>
          <br><br>The definition of Machine Learning is more thoroughly explained by Tom Mitchell in 1998 as:” A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measure by P, improves with experience E.”
        Currently, ML has been proven to be extremely applicable since Tech Giants like Google, Salesforce, Facebook, etc. are leveraging ML algorithms into their products. Particularly, some well-known usages of ML can be listed as: Manual Data Entry, Detecting Spam, Product Recommendation, Medical Diagnosis, Financial Analysis, Image Recognition, and the list goes on. The applications of ML are so widespread that people merge them into their daily life without being aware of them.
        <br>
        Let’s discuss a very typical example, most of us are vey familiar with Google and perhaps use its services for our demands/problems on daily basis. Back in 2010, Google declared that they were the first company to use ML into their technologies and services. For instance, its recommendation list after one types a word or a phrase, its Webs Rankings, and how it weeds out low-quality pages is fully or partly based on the Machine Learning algorithms. The technology for this recommendation system is known as RankBrain – a complicated Deep Neural Net Work that yields proper required results for users. Additionally, ML is also used in Google Translate to enhance the accuracy of the translation, its algorithms analyses thousands of millions of documentations that have already been translated from one language to another and figure out the most compatible pairs of words.
        <br>
        Another valuable application of ML is prediction of the stock market. There are many investment and trading firms developed their own or bought third – party algorithms to predict their businesses projection in the future. With the huge capacity of data analysis that Machine Learning offers, predicting the financial market is no where near impossible anymore. From the data from the past of a certain market/stock, ML algorithms can return the future trend , or it is also able to give markers for an event (plummets, peaks, etc.). Many people still doubt the reliability of those model but it is proving its position in the field day by day.

<h2> ✓ Cybersecurity</h2><br>
    <p><b><big>1 . What does it do?</b></big> <br><br>
      Cybersecurity is the defending’s process of many modern devices like computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. <br>
      Cybersecurity is an important part of many fields of technology, from business to smart devices and computer, which can be divided into many different categories:
“·         Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
·         Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data it’s designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.
·         Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.
·         Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
·         Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organisation responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organisation restores its services and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organisation falls back on while trying to operate without specific resources.
·         End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons are vital for the security of any organisation. ”
          <br>Reference:<br>
          <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cyber-security">https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cyber-security</a><br>
          At the moment, there is some new technology to secure our privacy and information, such as Face ID and Touch ID from Apple and Iris Recognition from Samsung. Apple’s Touch ID is the first advance security technology that Apple ever created. The Touch ID sensor uses advanced capacitive touch to take a high-resolution image from small sections of your fingerprint from the subepidermal layers of your skin and then intelligently analyses this information with a remarkable degree of detail and precision (Apple, 2017). “It also maps out individual details in the ridges that are smaller than the human eye can see, and even inspects minor variations in ridge direction caused by pores and edge structures” ( Apple, 2017, Advanced technologies). To unlock Apple’s device using Touch ID, simply put the registered finger to the home button to unlock the device, but if you fail to unlock the phone Touch ID, you have to use passcode to unlock it. Face ID is Apple’s most advanced hardware and software that they ever created. Using TrueDepth camera, Apple’s devices recreate a depth map of the user’s face and captures an infrared image of your face by projecting over 30,000 invisible dots (Apple,2020). To unlock a device have Face ID, you just need to glance at it, if it didn’t recognise your face or need update your face data from significant change, it would require a password unlock and/or update it. Iris Recognition is the most advance technology that Samsung ever create. To identify you, the device scans your irises to take biometric information. “And because virtually no two irises are alike as well as being almost impossible to replicate, scanning your irises is a fool-proof method of mobile security” (Samsung, n.d, How does the iris scanner work on Galaxy S9, Galaxy S9+, and Galaxy Note9?).

          <br>In the next three years, in my opinion, AI and Machine Learning will replace and make a huge improvement from our’s modern technique. Many organisations use a multi-layer security system. “This multi-layered security system usually starts with the best suitable firewall capable of controlling and filtering out the network traffic. After this layer, the second line of defence consists of antivirus (AV) software. These AV tools scan through the system to find and eliminate malicious codes and files” ( EC-council, nd, The role of AI in cybersecurity). In the near future, organisations will be able to monitor and response yo the security incidents by the build-in tools (EC-council, nd). The next-generation firewall will have a builtin machine learning to find network bracket and block it automatically if it might be a threat (EC-council, nd). It just not an algorithm; it can be analysed and identify the risks and stop it. In the future, the manual ordinary security task will be replaced by the AI and upgrade it into the automatical process. Some organisations use AI to strengthen their security such as Google use AI to block spams in Gmail and IBM’s Watson use AI to detect cyber threats and other cybersecurity solutions (EC-council, nd).

    <br><br> <b><big>2 . What is the likely impact?</big></b> <br><br>
    In the near future, AI and Machine Learning will be the game-changer for cybersecurity and many more aspects of it. As I said before, AI and Machine Learning will improve the efficiency of the security system and reduce cyber threats.<br>
    The potential of these developments will change the way of protecting passwords and authentication. “Let’s face reality, most of us are quite lazy with our passwords – often using the same one across multiple accounts, relying on the same password since ages, keeping account of them neatly as a draft message in our device, etc.” ( Remesh Ramachandran, How Artificial Intelligence Is Changing Cyber Security Landscape and Preventing Cyber Attacks, 2019). For example, in the beginning, I have mentioned some ways to protect our password, such as using our unique biometrical. But the attacker can easily bypass this function by using an image of you from Facebook or Instagram. But now the developer is using AI to improve the protocol of recognising to make it a more reliable system. Apple claims that by using AI software, there only one-in-a-million chance to bypass the device with another face (How Artificial Intelligence Is Changing Cyber Security Landscape and Preventing Cyber Attacks, 2019).

    According to Imperva.com, there are 20362 unique vulnerabilities in 2019, which increase slightly when compared to 2018. Because managing to check by human resources and current technique sound like impossible mission cause it takes time and no efficient. But with the help of AI, it will be much easier. Not like human, AI and Machine Learning will not wait to be the victim of the attacker. Instead, it is looking for the potential of vulnerability in the organisations and system by using many approaching ways like searching online for the prospective keyword on the dark web, famous hacker information and hacking patterns.     <br>
    Refefence:<br>
    <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/the-state-of-vulnerabilities-in-2019/#:~:text=Figure%201%20shows%20the%20number,compared%20to%202017%20(14%2C086)">https://www.imperva.com/blog/the-state-of-vulnerabilities-in-2019/#:~:text=Figure%201%20shows%20the%20number,compared%20to%202017%20(14%2C086)</a>.<br>
    The development of AI and Machine Learning will affect many people, from organisations, security methods and hackers. The one who will be benefiting from this technology improvement will be organisations and security methods cause it will be harder to bypass the system. But might be the attacker will use AI against its own the build-in defending system or create a new pattern to circumvent it.
    <br>The new technology definitely replaces some of the current job and some technology that we are using at the moment. Because it is faster and more accurate than human resources, maybe in the future, human resources will be reduced to invest more in AI and Machine Learning. It also replaces some of the technology we use to protect our computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks. Like I said in the beginning, with build-in monitor and using a complicated protocol, it will work more efficient, and the organisation will be able to observe what is happening now without waiting like the old techs. But the new technology will also create more job for programmer cause now they have to collaborate to create an IT and combine the Machine Learning with the firewall of many sophisticated devices.
    <br><br> <b><big>3 . How will this affect you?</big></b> <br><br>
    In my daily life, with the improvement of the new technology, I will be less worry about leaking my personal information. Because now the protection system is more complex and more difficult for the attacker to aim for many innocent like other users and me. Although AI and Machine Learning is changing the world slightly every day, my lifestyle will not change under the effect of it. If one day AI and Machine Learning are the most popular technology in the world in the future, it will open a new field for me to study cause it is a new field that needs to be discovered. Although AI and Machine Learning to change a lot for the cybersecurity industry and our lifestyle, I think it will make less change for my family and friends. For my parent, they don’t trust the technology and prefer to save it locally because it is more secure. And for my brother, doesn’t change cause he only needs the internet for social media and gaming, I guess it helps him protect his privacy and personal information. It would be helpful for my friend to secure their privacy and their future career when talking about cybersecurity.

<h2>Ⅴ . Project Ideas　</h2><p>
<div class="project">
  <h3><i>「CoffeeDear」</u></i></h3>
  <p>
    In the recent years, social media has been a game changer in the society, it obviously
    is going to have even more significant impacts on the future. According to
    <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/"><i>https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/</a></i>,
    by the year of 2020, up to half of the population use some sort of social media and it is increasing exponentially.
    Based on that brief statistic, it is undeniable that social media is a necessity for many modern individuals.
    With that being said, our team had a discussion with each other and decided that our project idea would be a social
    media application, which provides service for a specific group of people. Particularly, our initial intention to target the population proportion who have coffee as a crucial part of their mornings (or even noon, afternoons, evenings). Or perhaps just as a hobby.
  </p>
    <p>
      Coffee production is a massive industry with a long history of approximately 500 years and it is still a
      fascinating product that people talk about all the time. Parallelly, the coffee industry not only plays a
      vital role in the food and beverage field, it does have such great impact on the modern service industry.
      It is estimated that Coffee is the second-most traded commodity globally- <i><a href="https://dealsonhealth.net/blog/coffee-statistics/">https://dealsonhealth.net/blog/coffee-statistics/</a></i> .
      Let alone in the US, around 64% of the adult population drinks coffee daily. There is even some joke that coffee is the most
      popular ‘drug’ in the world. With all the evidence above, it can be seen how many people love their coffee habit. Thus,
      there will be a potential that the demand of coffee lovers desiring to connect as a virtual community is potentially really high.
      As a result, our social media platform will have a share in the technology market it the idea is carried out and delivered properly.
    </p>
    In terms of the production operation, it will basically help gather people who love coffee and promote them to share their
    experience of with each other on the specific types of coffee. Additionally, there is a long list of functions that can be
    thought of, however, their general purposes will be around the need of sharing information among the community. More specifically,
    since there are countless types of coffee, and each type has plenty variations based on different places, culture, materials, etc.
    and that unique information can be spread into the community for giving other some detailed insights.  Our product will also strictly
    follow the characteristics of a good model of modern social media platforms, namely:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Responsive.</b> From 68% to 98% of users access various types of social networking sites through smartphones, so the responsive UI/UX means a lot. </li>
      <li><b>Decentralized.</b>Ideally, you should create a social media website, which doesn't depend on the central infrastructure. The best option is a p2p model</li>
      <li><b>Non-anonymous.</b> The very essence of these services implies no anonymity. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of social networks, it's necessary to achieve correspondence between the profile and the real person (using a phone number, a scan of documents, etc.).</li>
      <li><b>Protected.</b> Also, your site must be secured from fake accounts and other similar unpleasant situations. So consider the protection factor: encryption/signature keys, blockchain data storage, etc. methods would come in handy.</li>
