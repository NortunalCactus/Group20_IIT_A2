    <h2>✓ Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h2>
    <i><small>"Written by Pham Tran Trung Hieu"</small></i> <br><br>
      <big><b>1 . What does it do?</b></big><br><br>
        <strong><b>Block Chain</b></strong><br>
        <p>First of all, in other to understand what Blockchain is, we need to understand what it is designed to solve in the first place. What I mean is that to tell a thing is fake or legit in our world, for example, our ID, license from car, bike to Certificate of educational attainment, or votes in the election we would keep a record of it. This leads to a potential problem that all centralized ledger have in common is that authorities could change the fact or history in the ledger for a not good purpose. As a result, we create and use Blockchain to solve these problems.
        </p>
        <p>So what is Blockchain?
          Block-chain is a network of ledgers ( record book ) that replicated itself ( by hash the present and the previous block ) when we made a change and are designed to be decentralized and distributed across all computers that participate in the network. The benefits of using "decentralized ledger" rather than "centralized ledger" is that is removed the problems of power authorities in the system since everybody is equally privileged. Furthermore, All computers in the network must verify every change. Because of a secure system, there are no intermediaries such as the government or third parties.
          <br/>Moreover, Blockchain, the first real implementation of this technology, is Bitcoin ( cryptocurrencies ), which was really successful in the recent period. Shortly, some of the application might apply Blockchain in the near future are:
      <br/>
        - The "smart contract" when people have to make a new contract for different purpose likes real estate or economic contracts.
        <br/>
      - "Medical record" since nowadays different hospitals have a different for each patient.
    <br/>
      - "Election" since it could provide the transparency of the votes.
        </p>
      <strong><b>Cryptocurrencies</b></strong><br>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is a type of currency that uses digital files ( blockchain technology base ) as money; the most successful one worth mentioning is bitcoin.
<br/>To explain things, better we could see Bitcoin as digital gold:
<br/>- When gold is mining with pickaxes, bitcoin is mining with computer hardware ( CPU<GPU<ASIC) to solve complex math problems in order to get a reward
<br/>- Both of them are not controlled by the central bank and can be sent directly from user to user (decentralized and peer to peer cash system)
<br/>- Similar to gold each bitcoin cannot be replicated, and both of them have limited amounts on earth ( 21million bitcoin to be exact), and because of “blockchain”, all transition are verified and recorded by every computer that process bitcoin, so it is impossible to counterfeit a bitcoin.
<br/><br/>However, different types of Cryptocurrency could have distinct features. For example, some would use different has functions like scrypt ( Litecoin  ) rather than SHA-256 (Bitcoin), increased the size of each block for faster transitions ( Bitcoin Cash), some could make a transition without disclosing the sender, receiver or the amount transacted ( Zcash ).
      </p>

        <br><br><br><br>

          <b><big>2 . What is the likely impact?</big></b> <br><br>
          <strong><b>Block Chain</b></strong><br>
         <p>Research has found that some potential impact of Blockchain in the near future are: For instance, supply chain process with Blockchain apply user could see know where their goods are at any times, big data uses when data need to be stored in large quantity, and access can be accessed fast, for example, likes tesla autopilot cars chain with traffic lights, auto pay tolls, etc. Also, public services could potentially apply Blockchain soon, like in the land register and proof of ownership when it comes to selling.
           <br/>
           Moreover, could it replace or make redundant any current jobs and technologies. In my opinion, I believe that blockchain, if apply, could take away many jobs at many companies, mostly centralized ledger-based businesses, for instance, banks, notaries, and the people who are running this system.
         </p>

         <strong><b>Cryptocurrencies</b></strong><br>
         <p>According to experts, Bitcoin promised to be one of the main ways we would exchange for goods. From my point of view, bitcoin could decrease the number of cash transactions if it is widely used. Another point worth noting is that people without bank account back then would be limited in different ways since most transition required the bank authority, with Cryptocurrencies. This could be solved since each transaction verifies itself.
         </p>
         <br><br><br><br>


        <b><big>3 . How will this affect you?</big></b><br><br>
          <p>Both <b>BlockChain</b> and <b>Cryptocurrencies</b> are not really affected my life to this point. Nevertheless, I believe that shortly both of these technologies will change other's life. For instance, back then, when I apply for RMIT or study abroad procedures, I have to went to People’s Committee to notarized my record, which was a painful process since it is taking many hours. If we can apply Blockchain to the study record of every person in our country, it would not take me to much effort to notarize my papers. Furthermore, with Cryptocurrencies, if bitcoin is used more widely and is approved by the regulations of Vietnam, we could pay for goods, make a transaction, and trade with fewer fees. Also, my family real estate business will be much easier if BlockChain was applied since we don't need to go to the painful process of "proof of ownership".
