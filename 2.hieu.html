          Blockchain's Practical Application <br>
          Blocks on the blockchain store data about monetary transactions—we’ve got that out of the way. But it turns out that blockchain is actually a pretty reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions, as well. In fact, blockchain technology can be used to store data about property exchanges, stops in a supply chain, and even votes for a candidate.
          Deloitte recently surveyed more than 1,400 companies across 14 regions about integrating blockchain into their operations. The survey found that 82% of respondents planned to hire staff with blockchain expertise in the next 12 months, and 39% already had a blockchain system in production today. In addition, 36% of companies said they would invest $5 million or more in blockchain in the coming year.6 Here are some of the most popular applications of blockchain being explored today.

          cryptocurrencies<br>
          A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled.
