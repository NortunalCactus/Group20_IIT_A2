    <h2>✓ Raspberry Pis, Arduinos</h2>
    <i><small>"Written by Joo Jeonghyeon"</small></i> <br><br>
      <p><big><b>1 . What does it do?</b></big><br><br>

        Raspberry Pi and Arduino are kind of single board based computer and controller. The most benefit of those is that they are invented user friendly. First of all, those size are tiny compared with the past one so that it allows us that we can hold those in our daily lives. Furthermore, those are created as an open source so that every people can access to those and apply those to adaptable software and hardware, even create new invention by utilizing those. To explain specifically, Raspberry Pi is type of mini computer so that it could be connected with monitor, mouse and keyboard. Also, it works normally as formal huge and heavy existing computer. Next, Arduino is small single board controller that could be used for invention of environmental-interactive stuff, receiving input value from various switch or sensor in order to by sensing physical movement and controlling electronic devices.
        Then what can be done now? Since Raspberry Pi and Arduino is user-friendly and easy to apply those to a various technology, there are diverse products with Raspberry Pi and Arduino that could be used in daily life. Firstly, as I mentioned Raspberry Pi plays a role as mini computer when it connected with monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Moreover, it could be applied to making FM Radio Station. Putting some code for Radio signals and executing software on PC by using GQRX, it could be exploited as a formal radio. Also, Raspberry Pi could be used wireless print server when it uses Raspberry Pi3 and CUPS software for running the print server. What about Arduino? Arduino can sense physical movement and changes so that it has wide spectrum to become diverse applications, especially in agriculture field. Through connected sensor with Arduino, it could assume humidity, temperature in order to water the plant or monitor sensitive crop that is picky to grow.
        Furthermore, it has numerous potential abilities. I suppose if IT is popularized in the future, numerous people could build their own laptop by using Raspberry Pi. Like this, laptop is commonly and widely used on our daily basis. However, even though it’s considered as necessity, it is still quite expensive. Therefore, to solve this argument, Raspberry Pi would replace the expensive device by consisting small laptop. Moreover, Arduino could function of thermometer that comes in a set with a laptop in the form of a USB. For example, if a person who don’t afford to go to hospital due to distance from there, they could notice light symptom such as fever, purse by grabbing the Arduino thermometer or sticking it with skin. After checking their body heat, if the person agrees with sending the information of fever, purse for checking their health to pre-selected hospital, they could get their health state and also book to see a doctor by using Raspberry Pi small laptop.
        Then, what technological or other developments make this possible? Above all, to give a shape to my thoughts, small laptop demands speaker, Bluetooth keyboard, audio jack, battery, plastic box for holding, on/off switch button, LCD screen within 7 inches and Raspberry Pi. Also, USB type thermometer required temperature sensor, OLED display, battery and Arduino board. To come it in reality, firstly, it acquires to find several companies and plants where can make a mass production of thermometer components and also other components of small laptop at an affordable price. The reason we need to take companies and plants where can mass produce is every component should be low-priced for popularizing to everyone. Also, at the government level, they should install internet connection line all over the country for commercialization. After that, people should acquire how to assemble parts into a complete whole. If every requirement meets needs, the imagination would be come true.

          <b><big>2 . What is the likely impact?</big></b> <br><br>
         <p>To illustrate the potential impact and change of this development, I suppose that installation of network for making those more popular would be likely to revive regional economy. Because in the process of internet server installation, there would be created a number of occupations. For example, nowadays, a lot of international companies are trying to develop less developed country by contributing money, install internet server, or providing educational support. In this process, it could offer various job opportunity such as tutor, manager and engineer. Also, I guess every component of device I thought up would be cheap in the future due to mass production. Basically, the more the plants produce part of device much, the much job opportunity get higher. For this reason, I think it’s potential to have a lot of job opportunity for underdeveloped countries’ people.
         Then, which people could be most affected? If every part of project is successfully fulfilled, as a first result, numerous people’s quality of lives would get higher than now, especially people who cannot access to internet server and who need basic healthcare service. For example, one person has a serious fever, people can check his body temperature and pulse by using USB type thermometer. Afterward, they can send the basic information and even book appointment to see a doctor. Also, they could conjecture what his disease by chatting with executive of hospital and searching much information on the internet. It not only doesn’t need to take too much time, but also easy to take much information from the internet. It would be great opportunity for people who have no chance but to stand their agony without information and interacting with professional health care provider.
         However, it is also discussed about its dilemma that this technology could be replaced or made redundant any current jobs or technologies. Personally, as I mentioned, this development would offer job opportunity for less developed country people. However, my idea is not so creative and future-oriented, there would not be various and so-new job. But one of the good things is installation of network and giving a educational job would not be replaced with machine. However, another one that is making component of electronic devices would be replaced quite easily. Also, about technology, it could be replaced with infrared temperature system that is take patient’s temperature without touching device on their skin. This is more sanitary, so it doesn’t make the risk of infection between patient’s disease or virus they had.

        <b><big>3 . How will this affect you?</big></b><br><br>
          <p>First, in our daily life, how will this affect us? If it developed successfully, it would have a positive impact on my daily life. First, it could mean a lot. For example, by gathering every component (Of course, just in device level, not in screw, or install screen in device level) all by myself. It would give a feeling of achievement and satisfaction. Also, in the process of assembling, it could give a lot of knowledge about the function of components and device. Moreover, it is connected with my major, it would be very helpful. Also, as a frugal, it way cheaper than other laptop such as Apple’s and Samsung’s. So that it’s more economical.
          Moreover, it seems to be really different for me. First of all, in every level of assembling, I don’t have to be given a hand from mechanic. It makes me much clever and prevents from waste of money to call mechanic with lots of price and from waste of time to wait for finish of gathering all of complex components from center. Also, it could be customized as different and creative design. I really enjoy decorating mine with sticker and picture. The outside case would be plastic one, it’s simple to decorate with sticker, photo and others. Also, we can change the case by purchasing other color case at cheap price.
          Lastly, how might this affect our family or friends? To illustrate the impact on my family, it would be affordable to use in daily life. Because my parents always speak candidly of their difficulty that their briefcase for work is too heavy to hold when they are in long rush hours. So, the main reason of problem is heavy weight laptop, tiny self-assembling laptop would be helpful. Also, my friends always desperate to find several unique stuffs, this device would attract them by its characteristic that is self-assembled, easy to customize. And it is potential to add more function by people who is proficient at engineering, my friends would be likely to add more function by studying and getting much information from internet and related books.
