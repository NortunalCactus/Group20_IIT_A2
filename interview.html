    <h2><big>Interview with an IT Professional</big></h2>
    <i>"Mr. Jeremy D. Mulally- Engineering manager/ Skedulo."</i><br><br><br><br>
    <section>
    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q1"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q1">1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</label>
    <p class="response animate">My current role is Engineer Manager, which means I am responsible for a few different things. First and foremost, I manage the engineers who work under me. Specifically, I’m responsible for their career development and personal improvement. Also, I help with the hiring process. My secondary responsibilities are delivering work, overseeing all different teams at Skedulo, making sure that they’re working effectively and reporting to the executive team.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q2"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q2">2. Can you please tell us about your history of working in the industry?</label>
    <p class="response animate">I began working in 1998, and I was still a sophomore student in university. Then I spent my first 13 years working as a software developer. Later on, I progressed from a junior developer to a technical lead role. The company at the time is involved in the development applications for the telecommunications industry, particularly for running on Windows PCs. Our software tracked the phone calls length and SMS to work out the fee someone needs to pay for their phone bill. The larger the population, the more complicated it got. Especially on Public Holidays, when messages are sent at the same time. So a lot of those problems were scaling at mass scale kind of problems. Then I got into leadership roles and operational excellence. Which eventually led to my management role now.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q3"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q3">3. Who are all the different people you interact within your work? Please tell us about them.</label>
    <p class="response animate">So primarily, I interact with software engineers. So in terms of seeing if they have any problems with their work, I can help if there's any organisational kind of blockers or if they need to be put in contact with the right people, they also work one on one with them with their career development plans. The second type of people I interact with is the executive team, and I keep them updated with the work progress. And analysing the potential business risks of a project with them as well.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q4"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q4">4. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</label>
    <p class="response animate">In my role, I don't very much interact with the clients. I had more interaction with clients as an engineer. Because you have to understand the problem the client has to work out what the best solution should be. But in my current role, I don't interact with clients anymore.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q5"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q5">5. What aspects of your work do you spend the most time on? Please tell us about these.</label>
    <p class="response animate">It does vary. At the moment, Skedulo is in a hiring phase, so I spend a lot of time interviewing people, reviewing resumes. And doing those kinds of activities takes up a lot of time. Some periods, we do something we would call analytics collection, in which we measure the performance of teams and track their progress to see if they’re on the right track.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q6"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q6">6. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</label>
    <p class="response animate">So, I guess for me, the most challenging part of my work is what we call performance management. When you've got a person who is underperforming or performing below expectation, and then you have to coach them to improve. It becomes challenging when you may have to put that person on a performance improvement plan. This is when they need to show improvement in every aspect of their job. Otherwise, more stringent regulations like a pay cut or layoff will be applied.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q7"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q7">7. Is there a standard scale or for measuring the performance?</label>
    <p class="response animate">So at Skedulo, all of our different engineers are ranked at various levels from junior to lead engineers. And there are different performance expectations at each level. And, as you rise as an engineer, there are more and more expectations upon you. And we have those written down and defined, and we expect people to perform at those levels.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q8"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q8">8. What would be the valuable skill set that you advise us to practice to be job-ready?</label>
    <p class="response animate">The most valuable thing you should be able to learn is continual self-learning, and make it the essential part of your entire career. Learning will not end after university as technology moves fast. There will be updates on new frameworks, languages, new ways of solving problems coming out all the time. So you have to keep yourself up to date. So that will mean getting involved with like professional groups, reading blogs, going to meetups, being involved with other people in the industry.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q9"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q9">9. So in your opinion, which roles will be more popular, front-end or back-end developer in the future?</label>
    <p class="response animate">In the future, both roles will be needed because each position will require the opposite position to fulfil the job. In our company, Skedulo, we have two front-end developers for every one back-end developer. Back-end developers are much more difficult to hire because the majority either go into front-end web development or mobile development. Good back-end developers are very valued in the marketplace because cause finding one is hard, finding a good developer even harder.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q10"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q10">10. You think about the projection of the industry in the foreseeable future. I mean, it is growing very fast. There's no doubt about that. But do you think there's going to be something that would hinder the projection industry?</label>
    <p class="response animate">I don't see anything hindering the projection of industry like technology, at least for as long as I've been working, which is like 22 years, it is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger all the time. The focus of the industry is changing a bit like things like machine learning is increasingly coming into the attention, but all kinds of software, even in ways you didn't usually think AI would be applied. It's becoming a more significant part of everything.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q11"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q11">11. What skills do we need to practice to get a good job?</label>
    <p class="response animate">Machine learning and data science are going to be in very high demand in the near future. High demand also because they're challenging fields, like the very mathematically intense as well as you need to be a good software engineer.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q12"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q12">12. What kind of working culture in the industry do you prefer to work? The culture of a startup or a large enterprise?</label>
    <p class="response animate">They are very different from the first job that I worked at for 18 years, and it was a large corporate company. So as a large enterprise company, and it is a very different kind of environment to a startup, which is much smaller. Typically, people who work at startups usually when they're young because they're exciting, fast-paced, high energy. But they're also high-risk cause the business can go bankrupt at any time, and you can be out of a job. So typically, people will work for a start-up to a wall when they're young and when they want more financial security, they will work for a large corporate company, but I did the opposite. I started at a large enterprise company, and I knew that at a point, I eventually got bored of being so safe and secure. So I began to find another job, and I started working at a solid startup, which is a higher risk, and exciting. In my opinion, startups are a lot more fun. Like there are fewer rules. There are certainly more significant challenges and more challenging to work. But I find that very rewarding myself. </p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q13"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q13">13. I've heard some rumours that in large corporations, you may have to work in a cubicle. Is that correct?</label>
    <p class="response animate">Yes! Generally, large enterprise businesses are very rule-based, and you work individually in cubicles, and you get assigned for specific work. But at startups, you will be in a group trying to work out how to solve the problem, because usually in a startup, the company won’t have enough employees to do the job. Therefore, you may play different roles, one day, you may be a coder, but another day you may be purely doing QA testing to try and solve a customer's problem. Or you may be talking to the customer trying to work out what their problem is, which is a product role. In a big corporation, we usually do the same thing day after day.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q14"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q14">14. What are some signs that you are not working well effectively as a group?</label>
    <p class="response animate">Most of the working is teamwork unless you're working on a very small project yourself. You usually work in a team of five to 10 people. The signs that your team isn't working are often around communication. For example, when you don't know what each other are working on and don't know the kind of problems each other is trying to solve. So, we think of your seams not communicating or talking to each other often those usually signs of problems within teams.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q15"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q15">15. Is there any severity of the kind of problems within a team. Like, is there a point where you should break up a team? Because it's not working</label>
    <p class="response animate">If you are a manager and you let it get to that point, you've pretty much failed. And usually, those kinds of things involve personality conflicts within people of the team. But that's very rare. I have never had to see a group broken up because of that reason. I've seen underperforming teams, where people needed some coaching or conversations. And a lot of that is around building empathy between people in the group and trying to understand people’s desires.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q16"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q16">16. Do you think the field is approachable for every people to enter at the moment?</label>
    <p class="response animate">So in Information Technology, diversity is a real and a headache problem. It used to be worse when I began but getting better. And it is all kinds of diversity, gender and race. In my opinion, as an industry, we are getting better and better at encouraging a range of diverse backgrounds, and also realising that various teams are just better working teams. It's good to have a variety of ideas and a variety of perspectives and a variety of people come from different backgrounds in life, to be able to bring all these ideas together in one team. And then you can work out which scheme is best or work out how your thoughts can inform each other to come up with an even better idea.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q17"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q17">17. As you are hiring people, would you instead pick us a very skilled person with years of experience or a newbie with the highest specification and qualification?</label>
    <p class="response animate">When we are hiring people, we usually look for what is missing from the team. If we have a group of all senior people, we generally look for some intermediate or junior people to put in that team, then considering complementary skills and different personalities. Because we don't want a team full of extroverts who like dreaming up things through which will lead to not executing things well. You're always looking for diversity in groups. And that's what we pick with hiring as well. Because once again, it's about the variety of perspectives, because quite often with a team of seniors with a lot of experience in the field. And maybe some of their ideas are a bit old fashioned, so sometimes a junior may be more familiar with the latest apps or trends or things that are going on and just bring fresh ideas. So that's why it's always good to have a mix.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q18"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q18">18. I've heard some stories, maybe they are wrong, and there are rumours, but some people have said that because they come to get through the human resources department, they will, they will reach out directly to the technical manager of the company to have an interview. Is that true?</label>
    <p class="response animate">That could be true! In some organisations which have a very formal hiring process. In a lot of large organisations, they will go through HR first who will look for keywords in your resume and years of experience. And if any resume that does not meet that strict criterion, I'll pass away because I get hundreds of resumes every day. So if you're coming in from a background less standard, usually startups and small companies a much better because you know you're not large enough to have an HR department to do that for you, so you're more open to seeing every resume. For example, at Skedulo, some of our even most senior engineers who earn the most Skedulo never went to university. They're all self-taught. So we also have some people with no formal training who just learned on their own over the internet and are now senior engineers here at Skedulo.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q19"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q19">19. In terms of soft skills, so, you have not only had to practice communications and just the general rules of dealing with other people but are there any other soft skills that we should learn?</label>
    <p class="response animate">Yes, soft skills are fundamental in IT, I wish half of my degree in software engineering were psychology because as you get promoted and become the more senior kind of leadership roles. Those aspects of how to work with other people become more and more critical. Like one of the obvious ones, you'll probably find just skills around facilitating meetings and having structured conversations.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q20"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q20">20. In your experience, should we pursue different roles to practice on as many skills as possible, or should we just concentrate on one narrow subject?</label>
    <p class="response animate">I think at least, especially while you're at university, you should try a little bit of everything. So try some back end development, try some front end development, try some mobile development, maybe even think of DevOps kind of activities or managing systems and infrastructure because that's an exciting career as well. You may not know what you want until you truly try it.</p>

    <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q21"/>
    <label class="animate" for="q21">21. Is that is it possible for us to achieve the role of full-stack engineers because you said that we spread our time into many different areas to find the most suitable interest?</label>
    <p class="response animate">Full-stack engineers are incredibly valued in teams because they have the flexibility to switch from front-end to back-end and vice versa. So I like hiring full-stack engineers when I can find them. But it is a more rare skill set because you have to be good at two things rather than one. Quite often, even though someone might be like a, for example, a front end specialist, but they have some experience working as back-end. That's better than just being a front-end purist because you have a little bit of appreciation of what you're trying to integrate with. So I think it's precious to be at least a little bit full-stack..</p>
